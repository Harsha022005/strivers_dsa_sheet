                maxi=max(count,maxi)

        return maxi            

Summary:
The function findMaxConsecutiveOnes finds the maximum number of consecutive 1s in a binary array.

Explanation:
count keeps track of the current consecutive 1s.
maxi stores the maximum number of consecutive 1s encountered so far.
The function iterates through the array:
If the element is 1, increase count and update maxi accordingly.
If the element is 0, reset count to 0.
Finally, maxi is returned as the result.
Time Complexity:
O(N) (where N is the length of nums), as we traverse the array once.
Space Complexity:
O(1), since only a few variables (count and maxi) are used.
