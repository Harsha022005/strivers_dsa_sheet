class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        maxi=float('-inf')
        curr=0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            curr+=nums[i]
            if curr > maxi:
                maxi=curr
            if curr<0:
                curr=0
        return maxi

Intuition:
The intuition of the algorithm is not to consider the subarray as a part of the answer if its sum is less than 0.
A subarray with a sum less than 0 will always reduce our answer and so this type of subarray cannot be a part of the subarray with maximum sum.
